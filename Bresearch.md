# Our Research
The ultimate research goal of STARs Lab is to maximize the value of data in real-world manufacturing, healthcare, and service systems, and make the system "smart" (learn "knowledge" from data). Our research direction is to develop effective and efficient data analytics methodologies, with the assurance of data quality, for information extraction, prediction, decision-making, design, etc. 

(Under construction, details coming soon)
